## Getting Started

Set up the project locally to explore or contribute!

### Prerequisites

- A modern web browser (Chrome, Firefox, Edge, etc.)
- A code editor (e.g., VS Code)
- (Optional) Node.js and npm for local server testing (e.g., `live-server`)

#### Integration with Provided Code
- **Content**: Reflects `index.html` sections (e.g., Tech with ML/AI cards, Events with hackathons, Mentors with placeholder profiles).
- **Navigation**: Includes links, consistent with prior requests.
- **Design**: Mentions cyberpunk aesthetic (#D81B60 to #00B0FF gradients, AOS animations) from Tailwind classes and inline styles.
- **Functionality**: Notes Web3Forms contact form, FAQ accordions, and mobile menu JavaScript.
- **Assets**: Warns about missing images (e.g., `images/ml-model.png`) and empty `styles.css`/`scripts.js`, suggesting users add them.
  
### How to Use
1. Create a GitHub repository (e.g., `jnct-dev-community`).
2. Save the above as `README.md` in the repo root.
3. Add project files:
   - `index.html` (provided code).
   - `halloffame.html` and `news.html` (from prior requests or create placeholders).
   - `images/` with assets (e.g., `bg.jpg`, `ml-model.png`, etc.).
   - Empty `styles.css` and `scripts.js` (or remove references in `index.html` if unused).
4. (Optional) Add a screenshot to `assets/images/screenshot.png`.
5. Push to GitHub:
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Add JNCT Dev Community with README"
   git push origin main
